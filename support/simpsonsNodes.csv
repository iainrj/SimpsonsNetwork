In \"Homer\'s Odyssey\" it is revealed that their father is Homer\'s supervisor at the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant. He fires Homer for causing an accident while waving to Bart from a cart during a school tour of the plant. Homer, however, had the last laugh when he was promoted above the twins\' father to safety inspector by his boss Mr. Burns. Their mother is shown in \"Bart Sells His Soul\" and looks just like her daughters. Sherri is two seconds older than Terri; they share their birthday with Rod Flanders. The girls themselves dress identically, reinforcing their \"twin-ness\". They are quite snobbish, and never miss an opportunity to berate Bart. Bart appears to have a crush on one of them, as admitted in \"Hungry, Hungry Homer\".

Burns is the evil owner of the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant and also is Homer Simpson\'s boss. He is attended at almost all times by Waylon Smithers, his loyal and sycophantic aide, advisor, confidant and secret admirer. Although originally conceived as a one-dimensional, recurring villain who might occasionally enter the Simpsons\' lives and wreak some sort of havoc, Burns\' popularity has led to his repeated inclusion in episodes. He is a stereotype of corporate America in his unquenchable desire to increase his own wealth and power, inability to remember his employees\' names and lack of concern for their safety and well-being. Reflecting his advanced age, Burns is given to expressing dated humor, making references to Jazz Age popular culture, and aspiring to apply obsolete technology to everyday life. Burns\' trademark expression is the word \"Excellent\", muttered slowly in a low, sinister voice while steepling his fingertips. He occasionally orders Smithers to \"release the hounds\", so as to let his vicious guard dogs attack any intruders, enemies or even invited guests. Mr. Burns is Springfield\'s richest and most powerful citizen. He uses his power and wealth to do whatever he wants, usually without regard for consequences and without interference from the authorities. These qualities led Wizard Magazine to rate him the 45th greatest villain of all time. TV Guide named him #2 in their 2013 list of The 60 Nastiest Villains of All Time.','http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr._Burns'),

His last name comes from Flanders St. in Portland, Oregon, the hometown of Simpsons creator Matt Groening.

When Moe Szyslak loses his temper at Uncle Moe\'s Family Feedbag, Todd responds with \"Ow, my freaking ears!\" prompting the Flanders to leave, after Ned comments that Moe\'s foul language is more at home at Denny\'s. Whether due to immaturity or a means to break away from his parents\' relentless sheltering, whenever Todd comes into contact with anything outside his family and their pious ways, such as the time he was tricked into eating a Pixy Stix by Bart Simpson, he turns aggressive. Todd can play the violin quite well, and is a part of the Springfield Elementary School band. \"Dead Putting Society\" reveals that Todd is good at mini-golf and, much like Bart, is willing and able to defy his father.','http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_recurring_The_Simpsons_characters#Todd_Flanders'),

39,'Dewey Largo','Dewey Largo, voiced by Harry Shearer, is the music teacher, whom Lisa credited with proving that any piece of music could have the soul sucked out of it. He is very uncreative and is a poor, pathetic music conductor. He is always seen in the opening sequence, teaching his class and throwing Lisa out of his band class when she plays a funky/jazzy tune on her saxophone. His last name Largo is also an Italian word for a slow, broad musical tempo, a possible reference to the fact that he can make any piece of music uninteresting. He is a lover of the music of John Philip Sousa, and is incredulous when Lisa suggests the school band plays something different. He has not played a large role in the series, but was originally intended to be an uptight foil for Lisa, and her non-conformist ways. After the first few seasons, Mr. Largo was rarely seen. However he has since resurfaced as a recurring character in the seventeenth season, making appearances in several episodes after. In the 17th season, in the episode \"Homer\'s Paternity Coot\" it is revealed that Largo was accepted to the Juilliard School, but never got the letter as it was frozen atop Mount Springfield. He ended up at Springfield Elementary instead. In season 22\'s Elementary School Musical, after attending a performing arts camp, Lisa is warned by Mr Largo that he also attended one as a child, and that they just \'fill your head with sugarcandy dreams that can\'t come true\'. A recurring gag since the 17th season episode \"See Homer Run\", are allusions that Largo is gay. The 22nd season episode \"Flaming Moe\" confirmed Largo is gay and in a relationship with an older man. In \"Eeny Teeny Maya Moe\", Dr. Nick mistakenly makes Mr Largo shorter, instead of Moe. It is implied Dr Nick was about to give Moe the sex-change operation that was originally meant for Largo, as he is heard to cry: \"I look nothing like Julie Newmar!\".','http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_recurring_The_Simpsons_characters#Dewey_Largo'),
40,'Lewis Jackson','Lewis Jackson is an African American character and one of Bart\'s friends and classmates at Springfield Elementary School. He can be seen playing the bassoon in the opening sequence of the show.

While Lewis has never had significant dialogue, he has been voiced by Nancy Cartwright, Jo Ann Harris, Pamela Hayden, Tress MacNeille, and Russi Taylor throughout the series.

Homer Simpson and his son Bart, who are at the race track in hope of winning some money for Christmas presents, see this and decide to adopt the dog. Santa\'s Little Helper has since appeared frequently on The Simpsons and the plots of many episodes center around him. During the course of the show, he has, for example, fathered litters of puppies, passed obedience school, had surgery for bloat, replaced Duffman as the mascot for Duff Beer, and been trained as a police dog at Springfield\'s Animal Police Academy. Some of the episodes that focus on Santa\'s Little Helper have been inspired by popular culture or real experiences that staff members of the show have gone through. Although animals in cartoons often have human traits, Santa\'s Little Helper generally acts like a real life dog. Cast member Dan Castellaneta currently provides the dog\'s sounds on the show, although voice artist Frank Welker has also voiced him. Santa\'s Little Helper has become a popular character following his appearances on The Simpsons. He ranked 27th in Animal Planet\'s 2003 television special 50 Greatest TV Animals that was based on popularity, name recognition, and the longevity of the shows.

He struggles to control the crumbling school and is constantly engaged in a battle against its inadequate resources, apathetic and bitter teachers, and often rowdy and unenthusiastic students, Bart Simpson being a standout example. A strict disciplinarian, Skinner has an uptight, militaristic attitude that stems from a combination of being trapped in a swimming pool full of earthworms for the whole weekend. and his years in the United States Army as a Green Beret, which included service in the Vietnam War, in which he was captured by the Viet Cong and was held as a war prisoner for eighteen months.

Smithers first appeared in the episode \"Homer\'s Odyssey\", although he could be heard in the series premiere \"Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire\". He is the consummate executive and personal assistant of Springfield Nuclear Power Plant\'s owner Montgomery Burns. Smithers was partly based on how numerous Fox executives and staff members acted towards Barry Diller. The idea for Smithers\' orientation came from Sam Simon, who proposed that Smithers should be gay, but the writers should never draw too much attention to it and should try to keep it in the back of their heads. The name Waylon was first used in \"I Married Marge\" and comes from the puppeteer Wayland Flowers. In his first visual appearance in \"Homer\'s Odyssey\", Smithers was mistakenly drawn as an African American by Gyorgi Peluci, the color stylist. Smithers\' relationship with Mr. Burns has long been a running gag on The Simpsons. Smithers is an obedient and sycophantic assistant to Mr. Burns. In many ways, Smithers represents the stereotype of the closeted gay man, and numerous overt allusions and double entendres concerning his homosexuality are made, though some of the show\'s producers instead refer to him as a \"Burns-sexual\".','http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waylon_Smithers'),

In the episode \"Team Homer\", his bowling shirt bears the name \"Pedro\". He works at the same studio as Kent Brockman. His first appearance was in \"Itchy and Scratchy: The Movie\". Bumblebee Man is never seen to take off his costume, even when by himself; the sole exception is the episode \"22 Short Films About Springfield\", in which his private life is shown. In this short segment, he is portrayed as innately clumsy rather than simply acting as such. In general, Bumblebee Man only speaks in simple, over-enunciated Spanish sentences. His catchphrases of choice are typically \"Â¡Ay, ay, ay, no me gusta!\", \"Â¡Ay, ay, ay, no es bueno!\" and \"Â¡Ay, Dios no me ama!\". Quite commonly, his phrases will be intentionally sloppy Spanish. For example, in the episode \"22 Short Films About Springfield\", there are several words used that are not real. The crude Spanish is used so that English-speaking viewers would still understand what was being said. On occasions, he also speaks English, such as briefly in \"Mr. Spritz Goes to Washington\". In \"Bart Gets Famous\", he anchored the news with an articulate English accent, filling in for the regular, Kent Brockman, who would not report the news because of a missing cheese Danish. Bumblebee Man is a caricature of El ChapulÃ­n Colorado, a character created and portrayed by Mexican television comedian Roberto GÃ³mez BolaÃ±os, and his show consists of simple skits, often involving heavy slapstick. The staff have said that whenever they watched Univision, this character was \"always on\", thus they created Bumblebee Man, who is also always on the air when the Spanish-language channel is depicted. His costume was based on one used in the Saturday Night Live sketch \"Killer Bees\". In 2003, Hank Azaria won a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Voice-Over Performance for voicing Bumblebee Man, and various other characters.','http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_recurring_The_Simpsons_characters#Bumblebee_Man'),

The Capital City Goofball first appeared in the episode \"Dancin\' Homer\" and shared the stage with Homer. In \"Bart vs. Lisa vs. the Third Grade\", the Capital City Goofball represents Capital City in the state legislature; he spent $80 million out of his own pocket to win the seat, and now is leading an effort to change the state\'s embarrassing, Confederate-symbol centered state flag.

In \"Whacking Day,\" Lunchlady Doris took the job as school nurse so she can earn two paychecks, but in \"\'Round Springfield,\" she reveals that she was put in the position of school nurse because of school budget cuts.

Duffman is a muscular actor, dressed in a superhero costume who spouts slogans while he thrusts his hips. Duffman\'s thrusts were first acted out by Brad Bird. His catchphrase comes from the song \"Oh Yeah\" by Yello, which the producers say became extremely popular after Ferris Bueller\'s Day Off and many advertisers started using it. As a result, the writers felt that the song and phrase \"Oh yeah!\" would be a suitable leitmotif for the character. While usually loyal to his corporate sponsors, in the season 15 episode \"Co-Dependent\'s Day\", Duffman reveals he is ashamed of betraying his Jewish heritage by doing a Nazi-esque performance at Oktoberfest. In the season 17 episode \"Marge and Homer Turn a Couple Play\", it was revealed that there were two more Duffmen working. Jaws Wired Shut revealed that all the actors who have played Duffman have died, which sheds some light on the so-called continuity error in which Duffman was referred to as \"Larry\" in Pygmoelian, Howard K. Duff called him \"Sid,\" in Hungry, Hungry Homer, and in Old Yeller Belly he self identifies as \"Barry Duffman.\" There are also international, culture-specific versions of Duffman for the overseas markets. Duffmensch, the German version of Duffman, wears a blue pickelhaube helmet and blue spandex leiderhosen with a dark leather waistbelt with beer-can holders that look like ammunition pouches.

Unable to help the Simpsons, Monroe refunds double what the Simpsons paid, and the Simpsons buy a new TV. Monroe appears in \"Some Enchanted Evening\" in which 70% of that episode\'s original animation had to be redone, although the scenes involving Monroe were mostly untouched, said co-director David Silverman. The script of \"Some Enchanted Evening\" describes Monroe as \"a heavy, chain-smoking, compulsive eater.\" The original idea behind the character, said Matt Groening, was that he was born Marilyn Monroe and was \"very caught up over that\", which is why he became a therapist. Monroe\'s voice is based on psychiatrist David Viscott\'s. Among Monroe\'s works is Dr. Marvin Monroe\'s Guide to Etiquette, which Bart receives as a birthday gift in \"Radio Bart\".

His manner of speech, including the impulsive shouting of nonsensical words, has become his trademark.

Lewis later guest-starred on the show as Frink\'s father in the 2003 episode \"Treehouse of Horror XIV\". The professor has received acclaim from critics, particularly for his bizarre inventions such as the hamburger earmuffs, and he has appeared on many reviewers\' listings of their favorite supporting characters from The Simpsons.

With the retirement of the character Lionel Hutz, Gil has been working as the Simpsons\' lawyer in later episodes. He had several jobs but suffers an unfortunate fate. For example, he was shot on his first day as a security guard in the bank. Having not succeeded in any of his jobs, he is often seen pleading with people, usually his bosses.

In \"Like Father, Like Clown\", Rabbi Krustofski had been estranged from his son for twenty-five years. He disowned Krusty when the young man chose to become a clown when Krustofski had wanted him to follow the family tradition of becoming a rabbi. Years later, after much exchanging of Talmud passages between Bart Simpson and Rabbi Krustofski, Bart read the Rabbi a quote from Sammy Davis, Jr. admiring the Jews, which finally convinced Rabbi Krustofski to accept his son for his career in entertainment. He and Krusty reunited on the air of Krusty\'s show. He later conducted Krusty\'s Bar Mitzvah, admitting that he had not previously, out of fear that the young Krusty would just make fun of the whole thing.

He thought it would be a funny parallelâ€”and a chance to do a lot of easy jokesâ€”if it were a clown instead of a singer who gets rejected by his father. The character\'s casting was fitting in that the real-life Mason, like Krusty, also came from a family of rabbis but rejected his destiny in order to become a comedian.

The writers originally intended many of these characters as one-time jokes or for fulfilling needed functions in the town. A number of them have gained expanded roles and have subsequently starred in their own episodes. According to the creator of The Simpsons, Matt Groening, the show adopted the concept of a large supporting cast from the Canadian sketch comedy show Second City Television.','http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_celebrities_in_The_Simpsons#Mr._Teeny'),

He is voiced by Dan Castellaneta. He is the long-time clown host of Bart and Lisa\'s favorite TV show, a combination of kiddie variety television hijinks and cartoons including The Itchy and Scratchy Show. Krusty is often portrayed as a cynical, burnt out, addiction-riddled smoker who is made miserable by show business but continues on anyway. He has become one of the most common characters outside of the main Simpson family and has been the focus of several episodes, most of which also spotlight Bart. Krusty was created by cartoonist Matt Groening and partially inspired by Rusty Nails, a television clown from Groening\'s hometown of Portland, Oregon. He was designed to look like Homer Simpson with clown make-up, with the original idea being that Bart worships a television clown who looks like his own father. His voice is based on Bob Bell, who portrayed WGN-TV\'s Bozo the Clown. Krusty made his television debut on January 15, 1989 in the Tracey Ullman Show short \"The Krusty the Clown Show\".','http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krusty_the_Clown'),
111,'Old Barber','Jake the Barber originated in one of the Tracey Ullman shorts, \"Bart\'s Haircut\". In the short, he cuts Bart\'s hair not to his liking and Bart tries several ways to hide it. Dan Castellaneta, who voiced the Old Barber in that short and in subsequent episodes in the series, based the voice on comedian Bob Elliott\'s. The Old Barber made his last appearance in the twelfth season episode \"Lisa the Tree Hugger\". He was voiced by Harry Shearer in that episode. David Silverman had to create a model sheet of the Old Barber for Jim Reardon, who directed \"22 Short Films about Springfield\".

Lovejoyâ€™s judgmental and gossipy wife, and the mother of Jessica Lovejoy. She introduced herself in the episode \"Life on the Fast Lane\" as \"the gossipy wife of the minister.\" Her catchphrase is \"What about the children?! Won\'t somebody please think of the children!?\" which she always says among a crowd when something bad is happening in the city. In \"Wedding for Disaster\", the parson who tells Reverend Lovejoy that his license expired implies that Helen Lovejoy is actually a male-to-female transsexual who used to be named Harry Schwartzbaum. In E Pluribus Wiggum, it is revealed that Helen is a Republican. In the \"Treehouse of Horror XX\" story, \"Don\'t Have a Cow, Mankind,\" Marge appointed Ms. Lovejoy as Lisa\'s godmother.','http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_recurring_The_Simpsons_characters#Helen_Lovejoy'),

Homer discovers her in a redneck bar in the middle of nowhere and is amazed by her voice. He decides to help her launch a singing career, much to the chagrin of Marge. Grateful for Homer\'s help, Lurleen becomes attracted to him and tries to lure him with an erotic song called \"Bunk with Me Tonight\". Homer, who had been ignorant of this, suddenly realizes that managing Lurleen could hurt his marriage, so he quits as her manager. A saddened Lurleen sings a song called \"Stand By Your Manager\". Lurleen\'s next appearance is in \"Marge vs. the Monorail\", a much rougher-looking Lurleen, voiced by Doris Grau, makes a brief appearance, in which it is revealed that she had been to the Betty Ford Clinic and \"spent last night in a ditch\".','http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_recurring_The_Simpsons_characters#Lurleen_Lumpkin'),
116,'Captain Horatio McCallister','Captain McCallister, more commonly known as \"The Sea Captain\", created by Conan O\'Brien and voiced by Hank Azaria. Azaria modelled the voice on actor Robert Newton, who played pirates in several movies. The writers\' \"love of sea talk\" is what inspired them to invent the Sea Captain. His character is based on the stereotype of sailors and pirates, including the stereotypical pirate catchphrase, \"Yarr!\" He is a member of the Springfield Alcoholics Anonymous and has a peg leg in which he keeps liquor. In \"The Bart of War\" he uses his wooden leg to have a vicious sword fight with Sideshow Mel\'s bone. He is commonly referred to simply as \"the Sea Captain\", though when he took the witness stand in \"New Kid on the Block\", Lionel Hutz clearly addresses him as \"Captain McCallister\". The Sea Captain is always seen holding a corncob pipe and squinting. He also has an artificial leg. As an entrepreneur, McCallister is equally incompetent. On several occasions, he acknowledges his incompetence with a depressed: \"Yarr, I don\'t know what I\'m doin\'.\" Although he once states under oath that he is not a real sea captain, at various occasions in later episodes he is indeed shown captaining a ship. His restaurant, The Frying Dutchman, is a failing business venture that does not generate enough income to support its owner. During the episode \"Mr. Plow\", the Captain pitches his 90 track sea shanties CD set in a commercial, which aired on Public-access television cable TV channel 92. In the episode \"Lisa Gets an \"A\"\", the captain appears as a penniless bum. When seeing Homer and Marge walking Homer\'s pet lobster at the beach, he approaches them and claims that he runs a \"small academy for lobsters\". However, when Marge refuses to send the lobster away to \"some snobby boarding school\", McCallister asks her for spare change instead. His only main roles were in episodes \"New Kid on the Block\" and in \"The Wettest Stories Ever Told\". In the former, Homer sues his restaurant The Frying Dutchman because they kicked him out at the restaurant\'s closing time before Homer had eaten all he could eat. In the latter, he cannot bring the Simpsons their food for numerous reasons like the \"chef having problems with tonight\'s special\", which was an octopus. He then ignores the family while playing pickup basketball games with the restaurant\'s staff.','http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_recurring_The_Simpsons_characters#Sea_Captain'),

According to \"New Kid on the Block\", Ruth divorced her husband because his career got in the way with his family life, but in \"Marge on the Lam\", Ruth tells Marge that all her husband ever did was \"eat, sleep, and drink beer\" and never gave her money for child support. She is usually seen as a background character, sometimes in events that occurred even before she moved next door. She even continues to be a background character despite her later imprisonment. She nearly always wears a red headscarf. In the episode \"The Cartridge Family\" she was part of the NRA. She was voiced by Pamela Reed in her first two speaking appearances. David Mirkin said that Pamela Reed would always give great performances and that he does not know why they did not use her more. The episode \"Marge on the Lam\" features Ruth and Marge going on the run from the law in a stolen convertible in a light parody of Thelma and Louise. Ruth makes an appearance in the episode \"Strong Arms of the Ma\", as a huge female bodybuilder, advising Marge to use steroids. It is also revealed in the episode that Ruth Powers went to jail and entered a beauty contest in which she was named \"Miss Mexican Mafia.\" Her daughter, Laura, has not been seen after \"New Kid on the Block.\"','http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_recurring_The_Simpsons_characters#Ruth_Powers'),
118,'Roger Meyers','Roger Meyers, Jr. is the current Chairman of IandS Studios, and is the son of Roger Meyers, Sr. He distributes the cartoon, which is frequently criticized by parents because of its violent nature. He is a jaded and selfish businessman who has nothing but contempt for the children who comprise his audience. In the episode The Day the Violence Died, when IandS Studios is bankrupted following their trial against Chester J. Lampwick, when Bart and Lisa are too late in providing information that could save the company, he tells them condescendingly, \"Great, mail it to last week when I might have cared. I\'ve got cartoons to make.\" He also possesses an extremely obnoxious and short tempered personality, where he only cares about people who can help him. This is displayed in his contempt for the writers of Itchy and Scratchy when Abe Simpson becomes the flavour of the month, going as far as physically abusing a fired writer and sending Lisa and Bart a letter filled with explicit and rude language in the process. And again when holding auditions for the voice of Poochie. After first hiring Otto, he then chooses Troy McClure, telling Otto \"Take a hike you bum\", when seconds earlier he was \"perfect\". In \"The Itchy and Scratchy and Poochie Show\", he creates Poochie in an attempt to bring the show\'s ratings back up. Homer is asked to voice Poochie, and does so. The show\'s ratings plummet, and Poochie is despised. He is nearly killed off in the next episode, but ends up being dubbed over to have returned to his own planet. In The Simpsons Arcade game mobile, he appears as a boss in the Springfield Mall and uses an axe, a mallet, and bombs that look like Itchy and Scratchy.','http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_recurring_The_Simpsons_characters#Roger_Meyers_Jr.'),
119,'Sideshow Mel','Melvin Van Horne, better known as Sideshow Mel, is Krusty the Clown\'s sidekick. He replaced Sideshow Bob after Bob was incarcerated for framing Krusty for armed robbery. Mel\'s hiring was never explicitly shown in the series and his full name was only revealed when he announced himself while trying to solve the mystery of who shot Mr. Burns in the episode \"Who Shot Mr. Burns? \" and in the episode \"All About Lisa\" on the portrait of Sideshow Mel in the past. He first appeared in \"Itchy and Scratchy and Marge\", shortly after Sideshow Bob was sent to prison, filling the exact role that Bob once did. Little is known about Mel. He is a Cornell University graduate, and a former Gulp \'n Blow employee. Sideshow Mel is revealed, in the episode entitled \"All About Lisa\", to have been the winner of the prestigious Springfield Entertainer of the Year award. The intoxication of applause made him reduce himself to ridiculous behavior for laughter, which he compared to doing heroin and checking email. Sideshow Mel uses a slide whistle to communicate on camera just like Bob. When not in character, Mel speaks in a grandiose English/Shakespearean accent and owns poodles. When Springfield inhabitants form an angry mob, Mel often takes a leading role. Mel wears a bone in his hair that has been used as a weapon. In one episode it is suggested that he got the bone stuck in his hair by trying to dig gum out with it. In \"Homerazzi\" it was revealed that Mel was in a bitter custody battle and that he has a son, who looks just like him except without a bone in his hair. In \"I\'m with Cupid\", he reveals he has a wife named Barbara, who appears in \"Realty Bites\" where they are bowling in a house that Marge tries to sell to them. She is revealed to be giving birth in the episode \"All About Lisa\", suggesting that Mel has at least two children. She looks like a European woman, and has light hair. It has been suggested that Mel is very wealthy, able to afford betting thousands of dollars on football regularly. Sideshow Mel is often subject to abuse by Krusty, just as Sideshow Bob was before him. Such occurrences include \'Krusty\'s Slide\', where he is forced into a mixture of pudding, pickle brine and laundry detergent, a tub of rancid BÃ©arnaise sauce and a tub of refried beans; another unseen one is in \"Krusty Gets Kancelled\" where he states that Krusty once poured liquid nitrogen down his pants and cracked his buttocks with a hammer. In the episode \"Day of the Jackanapes\", it is shown that Krusty can remember Sideshow Bob\'s name, but not Sideshow Mel\'s.','http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_recurring_The_Simpsons_characters#Sideshow_Mel'),
120,'Troy McClure','Troy McClure was a fictional character in the American animated sitcom The Simpsons. He was voiced by Phil Hartman and first appears in the second season episode \"Homer vs. Lisa and the 8th Commandment\". McClure is a washed-up actor, usually shown doing low-level work, such as hosting infomercials and educational films. He appears as the central character in \"A Fish Called Selma\", in which he marries Selma Bouvier to aid his failing career and quash rumors about his personal life. McClure also \'hosts\' \"The Simpsons 138th Episode Spectacular\" and \"The Simpsons Spin-Off Showcase\". McClure was partially based on B movie actors Troy Donahue and Doug McClure as well as Hartman himself. Following Hartman\'s death on May 28, 1998, all of his Simpsons characters were retired, with Hartman\'s last appearance in the tenth season episode in \"Bart the Mother\".

However, he has appeared as a background character in Moe Letter Blues, Homer at the Bat, and The Simpsons Movie. Sanjay can also be seen in the season nine episode \"Dumbbell Indemnity\" on a sign outside of \"Stu\'s Disco\" that reads, \"You Must Be This Swarthy To Enter.\"','http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_recurring_The_Simpsons_characters#Sanjay_Nahasapeemapetilon'),

In that episode, she had no name and was known only as \"The Generic Female TV Executive\". She appeared again in \"Girly Edition\", also as a generic female TV executive. In \"They Saved Lisa\'s Brain\", she was introduced as \"Lindsey Naegle\", a member of the Springfield Chapter of Mensa, and has since become a recurring character. The writers modeled Naegle on a number of network executives that they have encountered while working on the show. The character gets her last name from Hollywood talent agent Sue Naegle, president of HBO Entertainment and wife of Simpsons writer Dana Gould. Writer Matt Selman chose the first name \"Lindsey\" because he thought it sounded like the name of an annoyingly talkative woman. Naegle-like characters have appeared throughout the series, such as the OmniTouch Rep from \"Make Room for Lisa\" and Laramie executive Mindy from \"E-I-E-I-\". In \"Blame It on Lisa\", it is revealed that she frequently changes jobs because she is a sexual predator. Chris Turner, author of the book Planet Simpson, called Naegle \"an excellent allegory for the modern corporate age: you don\'t see through her because there\'s nothing else to see.\" Her political allegiances are not concrete: In \"You Kent Always Say What You Want,\" she is shown at the Republican Party headquarters; in \"E Pluribus Wiggum,\" Naegle is conversely depicted as a Democrat.

It usually appears as a part of The Krusty the Clown Show, watched regularly by Bart and Lisa Simpson. Itself an animated cartoon, The Itchy and Scratchy Show depicts an anthropomorphic blue mouse, Itchy, who repeatedly kills an anthropomorphic black cat, Scratchy. The cartoon first appeared in the Tracey Ullman Show short \"The Bart Simpson Show,\" which originally aired November 20, 1988. The cartoon\'s first appearance in The Simpsons was in the 1990 episode \"There\'s No Disgrace Like Home.\" Typically presented as 15-to-60-second-long cartoons, the show is filled with over-the-top violence. The Simpsons also occasionally features characters who are involved with the production of The Itchy and Scratchy Show, including Roger Meyers, Jr., who runs the studio and produces the show. Itchy and Scratchy are based on the cartoons Tom and Jerry and Herman and Katnip, and their names were inspired by \"Pixie and Dixie,\" who were mice on the cartoon show Pixie and Dixie and Mr. Jinks. The cartoons have since become popular among the show\'s writers and animators and are often added when an episode needs expanding. As the shorts became popular with fans, the writers decided to have full episodes that centered around the production of The Itchy and Scratchy Show and featured multiple shorts. The first was \"Itchy and Scratchy and Marge\", which was a commentary on censorship. Other episodes to feature the show include \"Itchy and Scratchy: The Movie\", \"The Front\", \"Itchy and Scratchy Land\", \"The Day the Violence Died\" and \"The Itchy and Scratchy and Poochie Show\".','http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Itchy_%26_Scratchy_Show#Poochie'),

Her first adult appearance is in the ninth season episode The Two Mrs. Nahasapeemapetilons. She claims that Fried Green Tomatoes is her favorite book, movie, and food. She has excellent culinary skills, demonstrated by her ability to make a wide variety of dishes using only chickpeas, lentils, and sometimes rice. She is also one of Marge\'s best and only friends, and they often walk their babies together. Apu is seen to be very romantically awkward, as well as quite distant from Manjula, and he previously told her that it was customary in America to work long hours, seven days a week, and to never see your wife. In another episode he dons a blonde wig, intending to ditch his family and return to India under the name Steve Barnes. In \"The Sweetest Apu\", Apu has an affair with the Squishee lady. After Homer discovers this, he and Marge confront Apu, who caves under the guilt and vows to apologize to Manjula, who sets him a number of grueling tasks in penance. Writer Richard Appel had pitched the idea of Apu marrying years before he wrote \"The Two Mrs. Nahasapeemapetilons\" for season nine. For that episode, it took several attempts by the character designers to model Manjula because making women look appealing in Matt Groening\'s drawing style is hard for the animators to do. Writer David Cohen named Manjula after a friend of much of the staff. Manjula was voiced by former Saturday Night Live cast member Jan Hooks from seasons 9 to 14, by Tress MacNeille in season 15 and Maggie Roswell thereafter.','http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_recurring_The_Simpsons_characters#Manjula_Nahasapeemapetilon'),

Glenn Close\'s performances as Mona have been well received by critics and she was named one of the top 25 guest stars on the show by IGN. Mona is the estranged wife of Abe Simpson and the mother of Homer Simpson. Homer believed that his mother was dead, a lie his father Abe told him when in reality she was on the run from the law. Mona first appeared in the second season in a flashback in \"Oh Brother, Where Art Thou?\". She returned in the seventh season for her first main appearance in \"Mother Simpson\" and also had a large role in \"My Mother the Carjacker\". The character appeared again in Season 19\'s \"Mona Leaves-a\", but died during the episode. An Inception-inspired dream version of her appears in Season 23\'s \"How I Wet Your Mother\".

131,'Agnes Skinner','Agnes Skinner is the mother of Principal Skinner and first appeared in the first season episode \"The Crepes of Wrath\" as an old woman who embarrassingly calls her son \"Spanky\". However, as episodes progressed, the character turned bitter. She is very harshly controlling of Seymour, and treats him like a mother would a small child, once grounding him because he did not say who was at the door after answering it, when it was \"The Sugarman\". She hates Edna Krabappel. Agnes has married a total of four times, once with Skinner\'s father, Sheldon Skinner, and following Sheldon\'s death she then married three more times, each time, to a tow truck driver. Several Springfield residents are afraid of her. When \"the real Seymour Skinner\" arrives in Springfield, Agnes turns him away, unhappy with her new living situation, largely because the true Seymour Skinner is a man who can stand up to Agnes and make his own decisions. Although she appears to not care for the fake Skinner, it turns out she really loves him, although she denies it in \"Large Marge\". This was evident when Agnes convinces Armin to come home to Springfield as he was the only one who put up with her constant demands without talking back to her unlike her true son. Agnes\' first name was revealed in the seventh season episode \"Bart the Fink\". Before that, the character was known as \"Mrs. Skinner\". In the beginning of the series, the writers made several references to Agnes and Seymour\'s relationship being similar to that of Norman Bates and his mother\'s in the film Psycho. In \"Boy Meets Curl,\" it is revealed that some of Agnes\' resentment to Seymour may have derived from even before Seymour was born&#160;â€” during the 1952 Summer Olympics in Helsinki, Agnes competed in the pole vaulting event while 9-months pregnant. When Seymour makes his first kick, he hits the bar, thus, making Agnes lose and subsequently crushing her dreams. However, this would contradict the earlier episode when it is revealed that Seymour is not her birth son; most likely a retcon. In Grade School Confidential, it is revealed that Agnes enjoys collecting pictures of cakes that she cuts out of magazines, a hobby she began in 1941. She does not like to eat them however.','http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_recurring_The_Simpsons_characters#Agnes_Skinner'),

Snake first appeared in the season two episode "The War of the Simpsons" as one of the partygoers during Bart and Lisa\'s wild house party. Whenever Snake appears in prison, his prison number is always 7F20, the production code of "The War of the Simpsons". Hank Azaria\'s voice for Snake was based on a roommate he had while in college. His name was first mentioned by Sideshow Bob in "Black Widower" when Sideshow Bob was saying goodbye to his prison friends after being granted parole. The character was originally named Jailbird. The animators assigned him to the role of Snake in season three\'s "Black Widower" and the character has gone by that name ever since.','http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_recurring_The_Simpsons_characters#Snake'),

He is often concerned about others and usually reports them to his boss; however, when he very rarely is the boss himself, he seizes opportunity and becomes stubborn and evil. Beginning with \"Team Homer\", it is revealed that the Squeaky-Voiced Teen\'s mother is Lunchlady Doris. Castellaneta lifted his voice for the character from actor Richard Crenna\'s as Walter Denton in the sitcom Our Miss Brooks. Several different models of Squeaky-Voiced Teen have been used throughout the series, featuring counterparts in Mexico, Australia, and England. Steven Dean Moore uses them all as waiters at the ice cream parlor the Simpsons eat at in \"It\'s a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad Marge\".

Tatum grew up in Springfield, but in \"Flaming Moe\'s\" he calls the city \"a dump\" and says \"if you ever see me back there, you know I really messed up bad!\" A former 1984 Olympic gold medalist, he first became champion after defeating Watson in the heavily promoted \"Bout to Knock the Other Guy Out!\", a fight Homer and his friends watched on his illegal cable hookup. He was so feared inside prison he could stop riots just by telling the rioters to shut up. Tatum also appears in \"Bye Bye Nerdie\". Lisa tests her nerd spray on him, which forces Nelson Muntz to involuntarily get up and start punching Tatum, to little effect. A sobbing Nelson tries to apologize but Tatum rolls up his sleeves and declares \"you leave me little recourse!\" At one point Tatum is seen to have kept pigeons. Tatum is a parody of Mike Tyson, with a high-pitched lisping voice, a menacing demeanor, a criminal record, financial problems and a tendency to make pseudo-intellectual comments like \"I insist that you desist\" and \"your behavior is unconscionable\". He also has an unscrupulous manager named Lucius Sweet, who closely resembles Tyson\'s promoter/manager Don King. Indeed, in \"The Homer They Fall\" Homer notes that Sweet \"is as rich and famous as Don King, and looks just like him\". King and Tyson were asked to appear in the episode but declined. Paul Winfield, who played King in a 1995 Tyson biopic, took the role instead.','http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_recurring_The_Simpsons_characters#Drederick_Tatum'),
138,'Ralph Wiggum','Ralph Wiggum is a recurring character on the animated series The Simpsons, voiced by Nancy Cartwright. The son of Police Chief Wiggum and a classmate of Lisa Simpson, Ralph is best known as the show\'s resident oddball, and is noted for his non sequiturs and erratic behavior. His lines range from nonsensical, or bizarre interpretations of a current event, to surprisingly profound statements that go over people\'s heads; and his behavior varies between blissfully unaware, to dim-witted, to awkwardly spontaneous, even occasionally straightforward. The very nature of the character has undergone seemingly differing interpretations over the years and within various media. The creator of the show, Matt Groening, has cited Ralph as his favorite character. He generally remains one of the more popular and often quoted secondary characters in the show.','http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ralph_Wiggum'),
139,'Allison Taylor','Allison Taylor is in Lisa\'s class but skipped a grade and has a lot in common with Lisa. She first showed up in Lisa\'s Rival in which Lisa feels threatened by Allison\'s talents and abilities. During a school competition Lisa has Bart sabotage Allison\'s Tell-Tale Heart diorama with a cow\'s heart in a box and hides the original diorama beneath a floorboard. Wracked with guilt, Lisa returns Allison\'s real diorama. Both Lisa and Allison lose to Ralph Wiggum and his Star Wars Figurines. Afterwards, Lisa apologizes and the two make amends. Allison has had a few speaking roles after that and has been friends with Lisa, Janey, Sherri and Terri at the school and on the bus, as she has been a background character most of the time. Allison is a favorite character of the Internet Simpsons fan community and features prominently in fan-produced artwork and scripts.','http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_recurring_The_Simpsons_characters#Allison_Taylor'),
140,'Cecil Terwilliger','Cecil Underdunk Terwilliger is younger brother of Robert Underdunk Terwilliger, a.k.a. Sideshow Bob. His first appearance was in the season 8 episode \"Brother from Another Series\", where it was revealed that Bob only got the job as Krusty\'s sideshow ten years ago because Cecil, who had always wanted to be a children\'s entertainer, failed his audition. He later became Springfield\'s \"Chief Hydrological and Hydrodynamical Engineer\" although he planned to blow up the new Hydroelectric dam he was building, so that nobody would know how cheaply it was made. Cecil kept most of the building money for himself, making it look as if it was his brother. However, Sideshow Bob, Lisa and Bart worked together to successfully foil him. Eventually, after losing the money, Cecil attempted to kill Bart which Bob never could, but ironically, this was foiled by Bob himself. His second appearance was in the season 19 episode \"Funeral for a Fiend\", where, following Robert\'s death, he convinced Bart to go to his cremation. It turned out, though, that Sideshow Bob faked the whole thing in another elaborate plot to kill Bart. He is voiced by David Hyde Pierce, who also plays the younger brother of Sideshow Bob\'s voice actor Kelsey Grammer in Frasier. Cecil\'s mannerisms and his relationship with his brother are also loosely based on Niles and Frasier\'s relationship in Frasier. Later, he appears in \"O Brother, Where Bart Thou?\".','http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_recurring_The_Simpsons_characters#Cecil_Terwilliger'),
141,'Uter Zorker','Üter Zörker, voiced by Russi Taylor, is an overweight German foreign exchange student with a sweet tooth, and odd habits such as offering his already-licked lollipops to others as a sign of friendship, and eating marzipan candies called Joy Joy) fortified with iodine. He was left behind on the Civil War field trip, according to the season six episode "The PTA Disbands", but was back in school, playing in the band in the season seven episode "Lisa\'s Date with Density." His subsequent disappearance from the show for a significant period of time has become a running joke. In "Guess Who\'s Coming to Criticize Dinner?" his biological parents from Germany asked Skinner where their missing son was, and in "24 Minutes" he is seen stuck in a cobweb in the school air vents. It is revealed in the episode "Jazzy and the Pussycats" that he can play the trumpet quite well. He even makes a Charlie and the Chocolate Factory diorama, but eats it before it can be graded in "Lisa\'s Rival". During the school science fair in the season 23 episode "Replaceable You" Kearney has a human skull on display with a sign on it that reads, "Is This Üter?" In the German dub of the show, Üter is an exchange student from Switzerland.','http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_recurring_The_Simpsons_characters#.C3.9Cter'),
142,'Kirk Van Houten','Kirk Van Houten is voiced by Hank Azaria. He is the father of Milhouse, and the remarried husband of Luann Van Houten. He wears glasses just like his son and wife. He first appeared in \"Bart\'s Friend Falls in Love,\" but it wouldn\'t be until season eight\'s \"A Milhouse Divided\" that Kirk would be portrayed as a stereotypical middle-aged male loser and deadbeat dad. Much of his character revolves around his extreme emotional depression after his divorce from his wife Luann. Luann got custody of Milhouse when they divorced, but Kirk has visiting rights and is often seen with Milhouse in later episodes. Kirk suffers from the need to cry all the time after his divorce, even in good times. The Van Houtens remarried in the nineteenth season episode \"Little Orphan Millie\". In that episode it was established that Kirk is of Dutch and Danish ancestry. Kirk previously served in the U.S. Army, and attended Gudger College. Apparently Kirk\'s mother is of Greek ancestry, based on the nineteenth season episode \"Husbands and Knives\". In the episode, Milhouse says, \"But that\'s the money Yiayia Sophia gave me for Greek Orthodox Easter!\". According to Luann, Kirk was not a very good provider, and she had to borrow money from her sister to make ends meet and steal donated clothes from the town\'s church so she could have a wardrobe. When Luann demands a divorce, Kirk is all too happy to oblige. Unfortunately, he loses his middle-management job at Southern Cracker, a job given to him by Luann\'s father, as a result. Kirk briefly attempts a career as a singer-songwriter, recording a demo tape of an original song titled \"Can I Borrow A Feeling\", with mediocre results. Later, he attempts to win Luann back by singing the song to her. Luann does not reciprocate Kirk\'s feelings, choosing instead to remain with her boyfriend. Kirk reveals in the episode \"I Am Furious Yellow\", where he visits his son\'s school on career day, that he was currently employed as an assistant to the guy who puts fliers under people\'s windshield wipers. Kirk also had a job standing on the curb holding a sign directing people to a condo development and worked as a scarecrow protecting a soy-bean crop, which resulted in his eye being gouged by a crow. Since being fired from the cracker company, Kirk seems to be unable to maintain a steady job. He once shouted at Luann that she had to keep up the alimony payments she owed him, and he has been seen at the Springfield unemployment office, perhaps suggesting that alimony and unemployment benefits are his only steady sources of income. Kirk was put in jail in the episode \"Pranksta Rap\" for \"kidnapping\" Bart which he greatly enjoyed due to him being envied by women and fed three meals a day. In The Simpsons Movie, Kirk is briefly seen attending an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting.','http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_recurring_The_Simpsons_characters#Kirk_Van_Houten'),

144,'Sarah Wiggum','Sarah Wiggum, voiced by Pamela Hayden. She is the gentle wife of Chief Wiggum and mother of Ralph Wiggum. She first appeared in the fourth season episode \"Duffless\". Like Bernice Hibbert and Martha Quimby, she is one of the less notable characters who hardly ever speaks; however, in The Simpsons Game she only ever says \"Clancy!\", whether hit by or in Marge\'s mob. In the episode, \"A Star Is Born Again\", at the Jellyfish Dance, Clancy mentions she was more beautiful at that moment than the day he arrested her, to which she giggles in reply. He then mentions he only planted the crystal meth on her so she would \"notice\" him. Sarah is his \"home force\" and he affectionately calls her \"Poppin\' Fresh\". In the episode, \"Grade School Confidential\", she immediately dials the authorities to Clancy\'s command. Ralph apparently gets his appearance from her, as the two look very similar. According to \"Eternal Moonshine of the Simpson Mind,\" Marge does not like Sarah at all and tried to keep her from Homer\'s cruise party.','http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_recurring_The_Simpsons_characters#Sarah_Wiggum'),
145,'Wiseguy','Raphael, a.k.a. Wiseguy, is voiced by Hank Azaria. He first appeared as the chauffeur hired to take Homer to the prom in the second season in \"The Way We Was\", but he has held numerous other jobs in the series. Simpsons sound editor Bob Beecher commented on alt.tv.simpsons that, \"He doesn\'t have one name. His character\'s name always fits the scene so he\'s gone by many names, \'Clerk\', \'Shopkeeper\', etc. But in the script the direction given to the voice is \'Wiseguy Voice\'. So call him \'Wiseguy\' if you want.\" Azaria does a Charles Bronson-impression for the voice. In \"Simpsoncalifragilisticexpialacious\", Al Jean and Mike Reiss had Azaria voice a Simpsonized Charles Bronson as a reference to this. As with his profession, the character\'s physical appearance varied widely with regards to hair and facial features for a number of years, with the voice being the only constant; eventually, he was standardized as a balding, greying man with a moustache. Wiseguy has been dubbed \"The Sarcastic Middle-Aged Man\" by the show\'s Internet fans. In \"Day of the Jackanapes\", Sideshow Bob calls Wiseguy by the name \"Raphael\".','http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_recurring_The_Simpsons_characters#Wiseguy'),
146,'Rainier Wolfcastle','Rainier Luftwaffe Wolfcastle is an action hero star and a close parody of actorpolitician Arnold Schwarzenegger. This basis has been drawn out over the series. Wolfcastle is a native of Austria, as is Schwarzenegger. Wolfcastle\'s wife is named Maria, just like the real Schwarzenegger\'s now separated wife Maria Shriver. Maria is a member of the political Quimby dynasty. Like Schwarzenegger, Wolfcastle is an active member of the Republican Party and owns a Hummer. In the episode \"The Boy Who Knew Too Much\", Bart Simpson tells Wolfcastle that his \"last movie really sucked\", alluding to Schwarzenegger\'s film Last Action Hero, which performed poorly at the box office. Wolfcastle owns a restaurant named Planet Springfield, a parody of Planet Hollywood, which Schwarzenegger co-owned with other celebrities. Wolfcastle has starred in many action movies, most notably the McBain series and the movie of Radioactive Man, a loose parody of the Batman. When clips of the McBain films are played in the order in which they aired, they form a mini-movie with a full storyline. Rainierâ€™s more recent movies have gained less renown, and he is even forced to do comedies and even standup comedy. Wolfcastle has made cameo appearances as an Academy Award presenter, a celebrity spokesperson, and a celebrity judge. In a recall election of Mayor Quimby, Wolfcastle ran for his seat. He has a daughter named Greta who had a crush on Bart in the episode \"The Bart Wants What It Wants\". The writers invented Wolfcastle as the action hero McBain for the episode \"Oh Brother, Where Art Thou?\". Because they liked the scene involving the character from that episode, they used him again in \"The Way We Was\", which was recorded and aired before \"Oh Brother, Where Art Thou?\" The McBain films satirize clichÃ©s of action films. The character was originally named McBain, until an actual film called McBain was released in 1991. That film\'s producers refused to allow the show to use the name, so \"Rainier Wolfcastle\" became the name of the actor playing the McBain role. Dan Castellaneta, the voice of Homer Simpson, doubles as Wolfcastle when Harry Shearer is absent from table reads. In The Simpsons Movie, a characterisation of Schwarzenegger is the President of the United States. He is very similar to the design of Wolfcastle but with more wrinkles under his eyes and a different hairstyle.','http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_recurring_The_Simpsons_characters#Rainier_Wolfcastle'),
147,'Artie Ziff','Artie Ziff is a narcissistic Internet entrepreneur who is infatuated with Marge, his former classmate. He is voiced by Jon Lovitz, except for a brief appearance in \"The Front\", in which he was voiced by Dan Castellaneta. Animator David Silverman based Ziff\'s appearance and body language on a former high school classmate. Artie first appears in \"The Way We Was\", in which he takes a young Marge Bouvier to senior prom. When Artie tries to grope her in his car, Marge flees and Homer takes her home. In adulthood, Artie tries repeatedly to coerce Marge into choosing him over Homer, with Patty\'s encouragement as she saw him more as the ideal husband for her sister. In \"Half-Decent Proposal\", Marge learns that Artie has become extremely wealthy, and she reluctantly accepts a $1 million offer to spend a weekend at his mansion. Homer assumes the two are having an affair, but Artie admits that he could not win her over. Artie maintains that people dislike him because they are anti-Semitic, but begins to acknowledge that his selfishness is to blame. In \"The Ziff Who Came to Dinner\", the Simpsons discover Artie hiding in their attic after he squandered his money and started an accounting scandal at his company, Ziffcorp. Artie manages to scapegoat Homer but he eventually confesses his guilt to the authorities when Marge berates Artie for his poor character and she reveals that his own selfish needs are the real reasons why no one likes him. After that, Artie is seen being comforted by Selma, whom both spend the night together and after that Artie turns himself in. In \"Treehouse of Horror XXIII\", Bart time-travels to 1974 and happens upon Marge, who is still a high school student. After he warns her not to marry Homer, Bart returns to 2012 and finds that Marge has married Artie. Marge leaves Artie after she instantly falls in love with a host of time-traveling Homers. She says that seeing them made her realize that she had married the wrong man.','http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_recurring_The_Simpsons_characters#Artie_Ziff'),
148,'Yes Guy','The Frank Nelson Type, also known as \"The Yes Guy\", is voiced by Dan Castellaneta. He first appeared in season ten\'s episode \"Mayored to the Mob\" as the maÃ®tre d\'hÃ´tel at the Springfield Dinner Theater. He is a character known for bellowing \"Ye-e-e-s?!\" in a falling, then rising intonation, and appears to be highly eccentric in both his speech and appearance. The Yes Guy is a tribute to the recurring Frank Nelson character from The Jack Benny Program, I Love Lucy, and Sanford and Son, whose trademark greeting in all his characters was a loud, drawn-out \"Ye-e-e-s?!\" Inexplicably, the original character could always be found working behind the service counter of whatever shop Benny or Fred Sanford might be patronizing, and his Simpsonian counterpart is similar. In the Yes Guy\'s first appearance, Homer asks why his voice is always stretched, and the Yes Guy replies by saying \"I had a stro-o-o-oke\". He also appears in \"Homer vs. Dignity\". He works at Costington\'s department store, works as juror number twelve of the Springfield Panel of Jury, and as an executioner at Springfield Penitentiary. Homer refers to him as \"that jerk who always goes Yessss\". A Brazilian version of him was seen in \"Blame It on Lisa\", uttering \"Si-i-i-m?!\".','http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_recurring_The_Simpsons_characters#Yes_Guy'),
